  review: "Ray offered what he said he would and went beyond that in helping me with some questions even though he was not a support consultant. Ray was easy to work with and even helped me at times that were probably not the best for him since there was a 7 hour difference. I will use Ray again if I need other Magento help."

  review: "Ray provided us with an in-depth explanation on Magento's backend. Clearly showing us how backend structures can be built within the short timespan of 3 days. They have done a real good job at clearly structuring and visualizing documentation for this, as this information very much lacks from the original source. Worth every penny."
