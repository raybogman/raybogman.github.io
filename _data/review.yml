  review: "Ray and I were introduced to each other a couple of years ago by a mutual friend. I perceive Ray as a gifted man. Somehow he is able to be a hardcore developer and he has an excellent developed skill set to present, do sales and negotiate while finding the best outcome for all parties.  In product development he is able to truly think out of the box and be a source of inspiration. The combination of these skills to be found in 1 man is quite rare. If you're lucky enough to work with Ray please send him my heartfelt wishes.."

  review: "Ray offered what he said he would and went beyond that in helping me with some questions even though he was not a support consultant. Ray was easy to work with and even helped me at times that were probably not the best for him since there was a 7 hour difference. I will use Ray again if I need other Magento help."

  review: "Ray provided us with an in-depth explanation on Magento's backend. Clearly showing us how backend structures can be built within the short timespan of 3 days. They have done a real good job at clearly structuring and visualizing documentation for this, as this information very much lacks from the original source. Worth every penny."
