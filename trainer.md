<h3>Customer reviews</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>"Ray offered what he said he would and went beyond that in helping me with some questions even though he was not a support consultant. Ray was easy to work with and even helped me at times that were probably not the best for him since there was a 7 hour difference. I will use Ray again if I need other Magento help."
