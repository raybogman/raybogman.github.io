### Magento User Group Amsterdam
In 2010 Ray started the **Magento User Group in Amsterdam**. In the beginning the monthly meetings where just a meetup of Magento lovers how wanted to share their passion on day to day Magento stuff. But over the year the Magento User Group has grown out to a noticeable mark in the Dutch Magento scene. Over the years we have organized (with the help of Byte Internet) many different Magento User Groups, like: **Magento Top 10 extentions**, **Magento Performance Bootcamp**, **Magento SEO workshop**, **Magento Payments partner compare**, **Magento Business to Business tooling**, **Magento Hosting provider compare**, **Magento marketing tricks**.....and so much more. More info on the Magento User Group Amsterdam, or if you like to signup [click here](https://www.meetup.com/Magento-User-Group-Amsterdam).

As of 2018 the Magento User Group Amsterdam meetups are orginized by [SupportDesk](https://www.supportdesk.nu/), [Byte](https://www.byte.nl/) & [Dutchento](https://www.dutchento.org/).  

### WebPerfDays Amsterdam
In 2013 Ray joined the team of Measureworks (main organizer) as Co-Host and Speaker for the Dutch edition of WebPerfDays Amsterdam.

My task: Finding sponsors/venue, hands on during the event and presenting at the event.


### TEDxAmstelveen
In 2017 Ray joined the TEDxAmstelveen team as **Tech Lead** and is responsible as webmaster for the [TEDxAmstelveen](https://tedxamstelveen.com/) website and managing the Audiovisual Team.  

### Magento Doctor
In 2012 Ray created the "alter ego" persona know as the **Magento Doctor**. The main reason for this was sharing knowledge about Magento in a independent manner at Magento events worldwide. Currently many **Meet Magento events** started using the **Magento Doctor** persona, only wearing a "Doctor Jacket" and focusing only on sharing knowledge about Magento on participants.
