### Magento User Group Amsterdam
In 2010 Ray started the **Magento User Group in Amsterdam**. In the beginning the monthly meetings where just a meetup of Magento lovers how wanted to share their passion on day to day Magento stuff. But over the year the Magento User Group has grown out to a noticeable mark in the Dutch Magento scene. Over the years we have organized (with the help of Byte Internet) many different Magento User Groups, like: **Magento Top 10 extentions**, **Magento Performance Bootcamp**, **Magento SEO workshop**, **Magento Payments partner compare**, **Magento Business to Business tooling**, **Magento Hosting provider compare**, **Magento marketing tricks**.....and so much more.

As of 2018 the Magento User Group Amsterdam meetups are orginized by [SupportDesk](https://www.supportdesk.nu/), [Byte](https://www.byte.nl/) & [Dutchento](https://www.dutchento.org/).  

### Magento Doctor
In 2012 Ray created the "alter ego" persona know as the **Magento Doctor**. The main reason for this was sharing knowledge about Magento in a independent manner at Magento events worldwide. Currently many **Meet Magento events** started using the **Magento Doctor** persona, only wearing a "Doctor Jacket" and focusing only on sharing knowledge about Magento on participants.

### WebPerfDays Amsterdam
In 2013 Ray joined the team of Measureworks (main organizer) as Co-Host and Speaker for the Dutch edition of WebPerfDays Amsterdam.

My task: Finding sponsors/venue, hands on during the event and presenting at the event.

### Guest lecturer (VU Amsterdam)
The idea for a web development Magento 2 Bootcamp originated by Ray Bogman (founder SupportDesk) and Quincy Dahl (founder [FRISSR](http://frissr.com/)) noted that when it comes to the knowledge of engineering students there is a gap between theory and practice. Students have a lot of theoretical knowledge but lack certain skills to be able to go in practice to work. In addition, Ray Bogman noted that e-commerce is growing and there is a growing shortage of e-commerce specialists within IT. (With SupportDesk are they always look for analytic young professionals with technical affinity that can provide complementary as regards e-commerce). There is a lot of demand in the market for B2B and B2C marketing, but there are few people who can help with this . The result is that waiting times for entrepreneurs who want to put into practice their ideas. (The demand for e-commerce IT specialists is large and too small supply). The will is there, but the economic growth is a limiting factor. A new growth, for example by educating students through this web development Magento 2 Bootcamp, Netherlands could make a career regard to e-commerce.

The Magento 2 Bootcamp took place at the **Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam** in a 10 week program. In total over the period of 2 year more than 50 students participated in this program.

### TEDxAmstelveen
In 2017 Ray joined the TEDxAmstelveen team as **Tech Lead** and is responsible as webmaster for the [TEDxAmstelveen](https://tedxamstelveen.com/) website and managing the Audiovisual Team.
